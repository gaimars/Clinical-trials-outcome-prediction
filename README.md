# Clinical Trials Outcome Prediction

Predict clinical trial outcomes using structured trial metadata.

## Status
Project setup in progress.

## Planned Workflow
- Data collection / dataset selection
- Data cleaning + EDA
- Baseline model
- Improved model + evaluation
- Simple report + reproducibility

## Problem Statement
Clinical trials are expensive and time-consuming, with a high failure rate.
This project aims to predict the likely outcome of a clinical trial
(e.g., success vs failure) using structured clinical trial metadata
such as phase, enrollment size, intervention type, and sponsor information.
